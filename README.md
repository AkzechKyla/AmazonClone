## Notes

*This project is purely for practice and does not include real payment processing. It is not affiliated with Amazon in any way. The UI design was taken from SuperSimpleDev's course. However, I implemented the JavaScript part independently without relying heavily on the course material. As a result, you may find a lot of commented lines due to experimenting with different implementations, along with some slight inconsistencies in the separation of concerns. Additionally, some features might not work as intended since only about 90% of the app is completed.*
